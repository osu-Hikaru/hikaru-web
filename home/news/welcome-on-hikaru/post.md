# Welcome on Hikaru!

Hikaru is a completely independent osu!Lazer Private Server.
Independent meaning we do not use any of the Ripple/Akatsuki Codebase,
everything is written from scratch and without any outside help.

## State of Hikaru

All parts of this Server are in **Heavy Development**. Expect things to break or not even work at all.

A ToDo list for the Project can be found in the [Backend GitHub Repo](https://github.com/osu-Hikaru/hikaru-server).
